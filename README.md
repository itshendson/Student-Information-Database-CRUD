# mern-crud-practice

## Description
This project is a straightforward CRUD application. The user can enter student information into the system such as a student's name and major. The student data will be stored in a database and retrieved by the app.

## System Design

## Still Need To:
- Make app pretty
- add in error handlers
- Fill in README.md
- ~~move POST request to main.js~~
- ~~add app architecture (done)~~
